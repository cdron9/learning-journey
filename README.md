# 🧠 Learning Journey

This is my self-directed journey into core Computer Science fundamentals, starting with JavaScript and moving into C++ for systems programming and low-latency development.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

- `js/` — JavaScript practice and mini-projects
- `cpp/` — C++ code and experiments
- `notes/` — Concept notes (e.g. sorting, recursion)
- `projects/` — Terminal projects and demos
- `roadmap.md` — Week-by-week learning plan

---

## 🛠 Tools

- Neovim for editing
- Git + GitHub for version control
- macOS for development
- Linux (soon) for systems-level testing

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo

Browse the folders by topic. Each week’s learning and output is guided by the `roadmap.md`. I commit updates regularly as I progress.

## 🚀 Goal

Gain strong fundamentals in algorithms, memory, and C++ so I can work on high-performance, low-latency systems and tools like version control or algorithm visualizers.
